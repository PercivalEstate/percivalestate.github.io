          <h3 class="major">History of the Percival Estate</h3>
          <p>
            The Percival Estate is an Islington Council estate in Clerkenwell so
            named after its neighbouring street to the north side - Percival
            Street - records show this was originally spelled as 'Perceval
            Street', named after a former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,
            Spencer Perceval. The wider footprint of the estate is enclosed by
            Compton Street on the south side, Agdon Street to the west and
            neighbours The Triangle Estate to the east.
          </p>
          <p>
            The estate was constructed in phases; it has a layered history tied
            to redevelopment efforts in the 20th century.
          </p>
          <h3>Cyrus House (1933–1934)</h3>
          <p>
            Built by Finsbury Borough Council and designed by E. C. P. Monson in
            a traditional style influenced by earlier housing projects. The
            five-storey block contains 40 two- and three-bedroom flats, with
            balcony access from a central courtyard reached via a striking
            two-storey archway. It was part of a redevelopment enabled by the
            Northampton Estate's discounted land offer and revised housing
            subsidies. The project included extending Malta Street (Malta Street
            has since been truncated and the southern portion incorporated into
            Compton Stree). The construction was handled by Gee, Walker & Slater
            Ltd.
          </p>
          <h3>Tompion House & Earnshaw House (1946–1949)</h3>
          <p>
            Designed by Messrs Joseph in 1938 and built by W. H. Gaze & Sons Ltd
            for the London County Council (LCC). These two six-storey blocks
            were named after horologists Thomas Tompion and Thomas Earnshaw.
          </p>
          <h3>Grimthorpe House (1950–1952)</h3>
          <div style="width: 100%; display: flex; flex-direction: row">
            <p style="max-width: 50%">
              Designed by John Partridge under the LCC Architect's Department
              and approved in 1949, Grimthorpe House was built by A. E. Symes
              Ltd. This eight-storey Modernist block with 128 flats reflects the
              LCC's post-war Modernist aspirations and is named after Lord
              Grimthorpe, long-serving president of the British Horological
              Institute. The building features dramatic glazed stairwells and a
              facade clad in hand-made stock bricks. It was substantially
              refurbished by Islington Council in 1984–5.

          </div>
          <h3>Crayle House (1959–1960)</h3>
          <p>
            Designed by the LCC Architect's Department and built by Stewart &
            Partners Ltd on the site of a former factory. Initially comprising
            20 maisonettes, the four-storey block with balcony access was
            altered in 1983–1984. It was likely named after 17th-century London
            watchmakers Richard and William Crayle.
          </p>
          <h3>Partridge Court (1976–1977)</h3>
          <p>
            Added by the Greater London Council (GLC) and designed in 1972 by
            Renton Howard Wood Levin Partners, with Ove Arup & Partners as
            engineers. This five-storey block houses 13 flats and maisonettes,
            including facilities for elderly residents. It is named after an old
            Clerkenwell family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each construction highlights the evolution of public housing in
            Clerkenwell, from pre-war traditional styles to post-war Modernist
            approaches, reflecting changing priorities and architectural trends.

              <p style="max-width: 50%">
                The Islington Council Grounds Maintenance Service has made some
                improvements to the sports court shared between Grimthorpe
                House, Crayle House and Partridge Court. The work has involved
                removing ivy and overgrowth and a general tidy up. Construction
                of step-free access has also begun at the west end of the sports
                court.
